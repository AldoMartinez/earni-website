# Privacy Policy

**Last updated:** January 18, 2026

Your privacy matters. Éarni is designed to help you track work shifts and earnings while keeping your data under your control. This Privacy Policy explains what information is (and is not) collected and how it is handled.

<br>

## Information We Collect

Éarni does **not** require account creation and does **not** collect personally identifiable information such as your name, email address, or physical address.

The following data is stored **locally on your device only**:

- Job names you create  
- Hourly pay rates  
- Work shifts (dates, start and end times)  
- Calculated earnings  
- Selected currency and app preferences  

This data is not uploaded to any server or external database.

<br>

## Advertising (AdMob)

Éarni displays ads provided by **Google AdMob**.

AdMob may collect and use certain information, such as:

- Device information (e.g. device identifiers)
- Approximate location
- Interaction with ads

This information is collected by Google to provide, personalize, and measure ads in accordance with Google’s Privacy Policy.

We do not have access to or control over the data collected by AdMob.

You can learn more about how Google uses data here:

<br>

## How Your Data Is Used

Your locally stored data is used only to:

- Calculate earnings per shift, day, and week  
- Display earnings history and summaries  
- Save your preferences for a better app experience  

No local data is used for advertising or shared with advertisers.

<br>

## Data Storage

All app-related data is stored locally on your device using secure system storage.  
The app does not use any external databases or cloud services.

Uninstalling the app will permanently remove all locally stored data.

<br>

## Data Sharing

We do **not** sell, rent, or share your locally stored data with third parties.

Advertising data collected by AdMob is handled entirely by Google under their own policies.

<br>

## Children’s Privacy

Éarni is not intended for children under the age of 13.  
We do not knowingly collect personal information from children.

<br>

## Your Rights

Because all app data is stored locally:

- You fully control your data at all times  
- There is no server-side data to access, modify, or delete  

Ad preferences and ad personalization settings can be managed through your device or Google account.

<br>

## Changes to This Policy

This Privacy Policy may be updated to reflect changes in advertising, features, or legal requirements.  
Any updates will be posted on this page with an updated “Last updated” date.
